description: Route OpenClaw tool calls through Latch for policy + approvals.
---

Latch can enforce policies on **OpenClaw** tool calls by installing the **Latch Guard** OpenClaw plugin.

This gives you a clean flow:

**OpenClaw** → **Latch (local dashboard/API)** → (approve/deny) → **OpenClaw continues**

## 1) Start Latch locally

Use Docker (recommended):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/latchagent/latch
cd latch
docker compose up -d
```

Open the dashboard:
- http://localhost:3000

## 2) Create Workspace + Agent Key + Upstream

In the Latch dashboard:

1. Create a **Workspace** (or use your existing one)
2. Create an **Agent Key** (Settings → API Keys)
3. Create an **Upstream** for OpenClaw native tools
   - Name suggestion: `openclaw-native`
   - Transport can be anything; for native tool gating we primarily use it as a policy scope

Copy:
- `workspaceId`
- `upstreamId`
- `agentKey`

## 3) Install the OpenClaw plugin

From the Latch repo:

```bash
openclaw plugins install -l ./packages/openclaw-latch-guard
openclaw gateway restart
```

## 4) Configure the plugin

Edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json5
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-latch-guard": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "mode": "enforce",
          "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
          "workspaceId": "<YOUR_WORKSPACE_UUID>",
          "upstreamId": "<YOUR_UPSTREAM_UUID>",
          "agentKey": "<YOUR_AGENT_KEY>",
          "waitForApproval": true,
          "approvalTimeoutSeconds": 300
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart OpenClaw:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

## 5) Test

Trigger a risky OpenClaw tool call (e.g. a browser action). You should see a request appear in:
- **Latch Audit Log**
- **Approvals** (if policy requires approval)

Approve it in the Latch dashboard, and the tool call will proceed automatically.

## Safe defaults

If the plugin is installed but not configured yet, it will **not block** OpenClaw. It will log that it is misconfigured and allow tool calls.

- See [Policies](/policies) to require approval for high-risk actions
- See [Telegram Notifications](/telegram) if you want mobile alerts (Latch-side)
