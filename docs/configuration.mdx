## Docker environment variables

`docker-compose.yml` sets reasonable defaults for local development. For anything public-facing, change secrets and run behind HTTPS.

### Required

- `DATABASE_URL`: Postgres connection string. With Docker Compose, Postgres is published on `localhost:5433` by default.
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: Secret used to sign auth/session data. **Change this**.
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: Public URL of the app (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Public URL of the app (same as above for most setups).

### Optional (Telegram approvals)

If you want Telegram notifications/approvals, you’ll also need Telegram-related env vars and a webhook (see [Telegram integration](./telegram.mdx)).

## CLI configuration

The CLI stores defaults in `~/.latch/config.json`.

See [CLI](./cli.mdx).
