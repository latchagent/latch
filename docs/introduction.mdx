description: Guard proxy for MCP servers with deterministic policies and approvals.
---

Latch is an open-source guard proxy for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It sits between your AI agent and its tools, enforcing deterministic policies:

- Safe actions (reads, internal writes) pass through automatically
- Risky actions (shell commands, external sends) require approval
- Forbidden actions (payments, destructive ops) can be blocked entirely

## Quickstart

Start here:

- [Quickstart (Docker)](./quickstart.mdx)
