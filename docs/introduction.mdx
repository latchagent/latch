## Introduction

AI agents are incredibly powerful. They can read your files, execute shell commands, send emails, query databases, and make API calls on your behalf.

But what happens when your agent decides to:
- Search for passwords in your home directory?
- Delete files it thinks are "temporary"?
- Send confidential data to the wrong recipient?
- Run a shell command that nukes your database?

**You need a human in the loop. You need Latch.**

## What is Latch?

Latch is an open-source guard proxy that sits between your AI agent and its tools. Every tool call passes through Latch, which enforces your security policies:

| Action | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| ✅ Safe operations | Pass through automatically (reads, internal writes) |
| ⚠️ Risky operations | Require your approval (shell commands, external sends) |
| 🛑 Forbidden operations | Blocked entirely (payments, destructive actions) |
| 🤖 LLM policies | Natural language conditions evaluated in real-time |

## Quick Example

```bash
# Without Latch
Agent: "Search for API keys in ~/"
→ 💥 Agent finds and potentially leaks your secrets

# With Latch
Agent: "Search for API keys in ~/"  
→ 🛑 Blocked by policy: "Searches targeting sensitive files"
→ You see it in the audit log
→ Crisis averted
```

## Key Features

  <Card title="Policy Engine" icon="shield">
    Rules based on tool name, action class, domain, and recipient. Most-specific rule wins.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM-Evaluated Policies" icon="sparkles">
    Write policy conditions in plain English. An LLM evaluates each tool call against them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Approval Workflow" icon="check">
    Risky actions pause for your approval. Single-use tokens or time-limited leases.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Telegram Notifications" icon="bell">
    Get notified on your phone. Approve or deny with one tap.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Audit Log" icon="scroll">
    Full history of every tool call, decision, and redacted arguments.

  <Card title="Self-Hosted" icon="server">
    Run on your infrastructure. Your data never leaves your control.
