description: Guard proxy for MCP servers with deterministic policies and approvals.
---

Latch is an open-source guard proxy for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It sits between your AI agent and its tools, enforcing deterministic policies:

- Safe actions (reads, internal writes) pass through automatically
- Risky actions (shell commands, external sends) require approval
- Forbidden actions (payments, destructive ops) can be blocked entirely

Repo: [Latch Open Source](https://github.com/latchagent/latch)

## Core pages (start here)

These three pages are the heart of Latch. If you only look at a few screens, make it these.

### Dashboard

The dashboard is where you create workspaces, agents, and upstreams, and see the system working end-to-end.

### Policies

Policies are the rules that decide whether a tool call is **allowed**, **denied**, or **requires approval**.

### Audit log

The audit log is the paper trail: every request, the decision, and redacted arguments so you can review what happened later.

## Other features

- **Deterministic enforcement**: decisions are rules-based (no “LLM deciding permissions”).
- **Action classes**: tool calls are classified into `read`, `write`, `send`, `execute`, `submit`, `transfer_value`.
- **Approvals**: risky actions can be approved with single-use tokens (and optional time-limited leases).
- **Telegram integration (optional)**: get approval notifications on your phone and approve/deny quickly.
- **Redaction**: sensitive fields are redacted before being stored/logged.
- **Self-hosted**: run locally with Docker; keep your data on your own infrastructure.
- **CLI proxy**: wrap any upstream MCP server without changing your agent.
