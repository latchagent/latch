## Local (Docker Compose)

Use the [Quickstart](./quickstart.mdx).

## Production notes

- Run behind HTTPS (reverse proxy like Caddy / Nginx / Traefik).
- Set a strong `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.
- Back up Postgres (volume snapshots or managed Postgres backups).
- Pin image versions and upgrade intentionally.

## Database migrations

On startup, the Docker image runs a schema sync to ensure the database is ready.

For development, you can also run:

```bash
npm run db:push
```
